.SH NAME
nash \- script interpretor to interpret linuxrc images
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnash\fR [--force] \fIscript\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnash\fR is a very simple script interpretor designed to be as small as
possible. It is primarily designed to run simple linuxrc scripts on an initrd
image. Arguments to commands may be enclosed in either single or double
quotes to allow spaces to be included in the arguments. Spaces outside of
quotations always delineate arguments, and so backslash escaping is supported.

Currently, \fBnash\fR supports the following commands.

.TP
\fBecho [item]* [> \fIfilename\fR]\fR
Echos the text strings given to a file, with a space in between each
item. The output may be optionally redirected to a file.

.TP
\fBinsmod [\fIoptions\fR]*
Runs \fB/sbin/insmod\fR with the arguments given.

.TP
\fBlosetup \fI/dev/loopdev\fR \fIfile\fR
Binds \fIfile\fR to the loopback device \fI/dev/loopdev\fR. See
\fBlosetup(8)\fR for information on loopback devices.

.TP
\fBmount -t \fItype\fR \fIdevice\fR \fImntpoint\fR
Mounts a filesystem. It does not support NFS, and it must be used in
\fBexactly\fR the form given above.

.TP
\fBraidautorun \fImddevice\fR
Runs raid autodetection on all raid-typed partitions. \fImddevice\fR must
be a raid device (any will do).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-\-force\fR
Allows \fBforce\fR really execute the script, even though \fBnash\fR doesn't 
appear to be running from an initrd image.

.SH BUGS
Probably many. \fBnash\fR is \fbnot a shell\fR, and it shouldn't be though of
as one. It isn't entirely different from a shell, but that's mostly by
accident.
